Summary of Solution:

	This document describes an IoT system architecture upon which an application 
	in the space of water conservation and reclamation has been built. The application
	described herein is a submittal for the Samsung MAD Challenge extended IoT hackathon.

	This solution puts in place an architecture that will foster proper wide-spread use of scarce
	resources, such as water in this application. Once educated on the benefits of conservation, 
	individuals may team up from within a physically contiguous organization (such as a home or business), 
	or join forces along other lines of organization, such as 'fantasy conservation teams', or as common 
	participants in a crowd-funding campaign focused on solving water shortage problems with new devices and services.
	The possibilities are truly only limited by how any group of people can imagine combining their 
	efforts with others that are also concerned about water conservation. This approach enables a more 
	widespread knowledge of the problem, since groups of concerned people influence others to join in
	the effort of decreasing consumption, whether directly or indirectly. As a result, the solutions
	and participation will experience a multiplying factor in how effective they can become.

	The methods and scope of this submittal are embodied in a prototype architecture that
	demonstrates:

		1. Use of policy to enact voluntary water challenge quotas per individual and per organization via
			operation of smart water flow control and sensing mechanisms built with IoT devices in the main
			plumbing and water consumption endpoints (e.g., faucet, toilets, showers/bathtubs, dishwashers, and 
			washing machines). Some of these endpoints are to be monitored yet available for nearly unrestricted 
			use (certain faucets and toilets) by any individual. Other endpoints provide opportunities for 
			reduction in consumption. These endpoints include showers/bathtubs and sprinkler systems. Certain endpoints
			can benefit from being serviced, once filtered, from a reclamation tank (e.g., toilet refill, garden irrigation)
			Other endpoints such as dishwashers and washing machines provide opportunity for civic contribution 
			and collaboration, as discussed in more detail in 3. and 4. below.

			The challenge quotas are intended to be achievable and have progressive levels of rewards 
			for achieving/over-achieving. These rewards can include: social recognition, automatically
			enacted policy-based financial benefits, gift cards, unlocking of entertainment options, etc.
			As a result, tracking progress to the challenge goals could provide benefits in other external
			systems/communities, as well as provide benefits from directly within a smart home setting (i.e., entertainment
			options). Example of benefits from external communities are: access to online or venue-based experiences with 
			celebrities of note, either in an exclusive group setting, or as part of a contest one is allowed to
			enter based on conservation patterns.

			The important point it that claiming rewards results in transfer of value of conserving water into 
			economies that are personally important to each individual. Many possibilities could be created given
			proper agreements and technical integrations are in place.

		2. Use of data to:
			a. enhance an individual's understanding of the broader impact of consumption patterns
			b. provide understanding of the impact of equipment upgrades and purchase of, for example,
			reclamation systems

		3. Incorporation of civic sensitivity. At times of water shortage, civic response through prioritization
			of the use of scarse water resources is essential. Therefore, the solution enables an organization to
			mark some water consumption endpoints as pre-emptable if a higher predetermined civic need, or
			category of needs is identified. Some example civic needs include: providing water to firefighters
			battling to preserve homes and lives during a wildfire, and providing irrigation water to
			a local little-league ballfield. Examples of pre-emptable water consumption endpoints include:
			sprinkler systems, dishwashers and washing machines. Dishwashers and washing machine pre-emption
			would be most useful to address a period of acute short-term shortage by delaying or cancelling for
			a period of time during which loss of those capabilities could be offset with extra clean dishes and
			clothing.

		4. Incorporation of collaboration features. The water consumption endpoints are able to track use to the level
			of an individual. This enables, for example, two individuals to collaborate on a task that will result
			in water consumption while gaining additional rewards that reinforce this collaborative effort. Collaboration,
			though it does not result in immediate water conservation, does result in a shift in mindset toward water
			conservation by attaching a reward to a task that will consume water. This makes chores more bearable
			for the children in a home while teaching them about the civic duty of conservation at a potentially early age.

	One ARTIK10 development board is used to enable all of the functionality above.

	Though the current application of the architecture described herein is
	targeted at water conservation and reclamation, the architecture is built
	to enable generalization of the solution domain to include applications
	that are distinct from water conservation and reclamation. Inversion of
	users and devices is considered up front in the design as well.

Architectural description:

	The IoT system architecture, as tailored for this application, is comprised of:

		1. A physical water flow system that serves as:
			a. A scaled model representation of a physically larger water flow system 
			in an organization. The physically larger system would likely also 
			contain more IoT devices than the scaled model. These additional devices are
			emulated (see 2. below)

		2. Water flow devices emulated in server software to augment the limited number of physical devices
			that could be feasibly controlled and monitored given limited development board resources
			a. Augmenting the physical system of one organization and fully emulating an
				relatively arbitrary number of completely virtual systems enables visualization
				of the behavior of a collection of organizations, all operating with different system
				composition, policies, usage patterns and rewards structures, yet participate in common civic 
				conservation efforts and have individuals that connect across organizations for shared
				reward interests.

		3. An ARTIK10 IoT development board, responsible for all of the following:
			a. Monitoring and/or control of water flow to points of consumption in an organization modeled by a 
				combination of the systems of 1. and 2.
			b. Providing the emulation features of 2., including all pertinent behavioral modeling (described
				below - TBD)
			c. Providing APIs to hybrid mobile applications and a dashboard (described below - TBD) and enabling, broadly:
				 i. hybrid mobile application API:
				 	- interacts with requests for water usage for users ('initiators') in the organization when those 
				 		users are known to be present within the boundary of the organization;
					- for those with administrative priviledges, provides administrative functions for modification of, 
						for example, operation of the water system, quotas, and rewards.
				ii. emulation control dashboard: for all aspects of control of the emulation (described below - TBD) 
					(i.e., set initial conditions, change condition setpoints, start, pause, stop the emulation, 
					inject civic actions that could pre-empt a device)
			d. Hosting a local replica of a database that provides:
				  	i. Data structures for initiators (users) that provide (Dave, please fill in):
				  	-
				  	-
				  	-
				  ii. Data structures for providers (water consumption devices (endpoints)) that provide
				 		(Dave, please fill in):
				 	-
				 	-
				 	-
				 iii. Data structures for quotas (Dave, please fill in):
				  iv. Data structures for rewards (Dave, please fill in):
				   v. Data structures for ... (Dave, please fill in):


Hybrid mobile app functional and use-case description and description of API:

	The hybrid mobile app has three non-admin tabs with functionality as described:
		1. Request
			a. Provides a listing of the water devices in the organization
			b. Enables user to request and operate the water device of choice, subject
				to the policy (including civic preemption)
			c. Enables user to see the current state of each water device, including
				  i. on/off
				 ii. reason why not permissive if non-permissive
				iii. who is using and length of time in use
				 iv. civic feature inhibit enabled or not
			d. Enables user to query usage statistics for last k uses
			e. Enables user to view total usage relative to quota
		2. Schedule/negotiate/social
			a. Provides a location where two users may collaborate to obtain additional rewards
				consistent with the collaboration reward aspect of the policy
			b. Provides an interface from which users can pair across social networks with
				those who also value conservation
			c. Provides an interface for seeing how well one is contributing as a 'player'
				on a fantasy conservation league team
		3. Quota/Reward
			a. Provides a listing of the current selected rewards and progress toward
				obtaining them
			b. Enables changing the rewards to other reward types that the user has saved
			c. Provides a rollup view of progress relative to quotas and enables the transferral
				of quota across devices to ensure flexibility in achieving the overall quota
			d. Provides tips on how to meet the quota if the user is nearing the total quota

	Use cases are as follows:
		1. Single person use case
			a. If user is present in organization, then user selects the device thereby exposing
				functions associated with it
			b. User then either:
				  i. checks status and decides to use the device later
				 ii. checks status and decides to check quota (if not an unrestricted use water consumption
				 		endpoint) and then request and use
				iii. checks status, checks quota, shifts quotas among devices and then requests and uses
				 iv. checks status, checks quota, shifts quotas among devices, changes rewards and then requests and uses
			c. While in use, consumption logs are maintained based on the flow through the device as measured
				by the water flow meters
			d. When use is complete, the state and user of the device are updated to all of the hybrid mobile
				applications, and usage is updated in the database, thereby updating all of the views the user might
				see after use. Usage only accumulates over the ON to OFF command window, for simplicity
		
		2. Collaboration use case
			a. If device to operate is not a personal use device and user would like to gain additional rewards, user
				may use the functionality on this tab to collaborate. This assumes, of course, that the user is present
				in the organization
			b. User identifies device and confirms it should be operated and is currently off
			c. User identifies a collaborator
			d. User sends a message outside the hybrid mobile app to other party asking if they wish to collaborate.
			e. When a collaborator is selected, each person must initiate the use of the water device to turn it on
			f. Once running, the consumption counts toward to organiational quota for that device and the total quota

		3. Civic feature use case
			a. This feature can pre-empt either the single person or collaboration use case
			b. When a device is pre-empted, it will not become permissive and will display a message indicating that
				a civic override is in place

		4. Admin use case
			a. If the user is an adminstrator, they can, for any other user that is not an administrator:
				   i. Change quota
				  ii. View usage statistics that the user can see
				 iii. Shut off a device
				  iv. Toggle civic feature and change events that enable civic feature inhibit

Dave,

NOTE: All of the above is quite accurate and complete. However, the API calls to support the above are NOT complete
		Therefore, any ideas for the format or the composition of the APIs to achieve the above functionality are
		needed. Please craft the API calls as you see fit to achieve the above. This will allow me to work on interfacing
		to the physical system.

	The hybrid mobile applicaton API calls could be of the format field1:field2:field3:field4:field5. I made the following
	mappings as an example and began the definition of some simple APIs:

	field1: user1		(used for single user and collaboration use cases)
	field2: user2		(used only for collaboration use cases and otherwise 'nil')
	field3: device		(used for all commands and status)
	field4: action		(used for all commands)
	field5: metadata	(used as an optional augmenting field when fields 1-4 are insufficient for what is needed)

		1. Request tab
			a. user1:nil:device:getState:nil
				returns the state of the device to the hybrid mobile application
			b. [user1:nil:device:requestOperation:nil | user1:user2:device:requestOperation:nil]

			c. [user1:nil:device:On:nil | user1:user2:device:On:nil]
			d. [user1:nil:device:Off:nil | user1:user2:device:Off:nil]
		2. Schedule/negotiate/social tab
			a. user1:nil:device:ChoseCollaborator:nil
			b. user1:nil:device:ChoseCollaborator:nil
		3. Quota/Reward tab
